It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first .

I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . I can ' t believe she would do that to you . It ' s so dishonest---and rude ! I know . I still haven ' t heard from her . The good thing is that I ' m so angry with her that I don ' t feel sad about not having her around . I bet you she regrets what she ' s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ' t she ? I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . I know . It ' s always nice to have some closure , but I don ' t think you ' ll have a problem finding another girlfriend .",

That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . That makes sense . I'm going to try that . You don't need to lose weight .

We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery !

You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . It seems you two bring out the best of one another . Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . Thanks , I think so too .",

What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! I told you we should have stayed in town today . The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow . Why did you want to come up here ? I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? I don't know . I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . What do you mean ? We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time . We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . I have plenty of gas . Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working . We can't just let the car run and run . If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . So what can we do ? Turn the lights off . Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour . That will conserve the heat as long as possible . Alright . That's a good idea . I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . Days ? Yes , it happens . That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . Probably we'll survive . But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . Okay , I'll follow your advice .",

Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! Wow . See ? It ' s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of .

I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . let's hope so .",

That's about five blocks . And around corners too . So he was definitely following you . Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it . Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him . He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious . What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least . He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it . But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much . Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out .

Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . Like what ? It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . Sounds marvelous . You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing .",

That's not very fair . What did you do ? There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way .",

The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! Want some more ? I'm stuffed !",

Your sister ' s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ' s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ' ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ?

Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . Good . Let ' s go now .

Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . That ' s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . What ' s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ' t people do something to stop it ? It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .",

I need a volunteer . Me ! Me ! Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . Wait , what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this ! Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . Well , OK . But no French kissing ! As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . Wait , what are you doing !

Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? They'll still charge us a corkage fee . That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . I won't argue with that ! Let's go !",

What kind of drugs was he using ? he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . I agree .

And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome .

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .

Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?

My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that .",

Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat !",

What tips did your trainer give you ? Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . That makes sense . I'm going to try that . You don't need to lose weight . I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . Thanks for the advice . No problem .",

How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? That looks great .

No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things .

He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . Me too . Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . And the host announced that he won it all !",

Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ' s a real mess . For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? Um ... how can I put this ? Let ' s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ' s the bad news ? Oh , that ' s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ' re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ' re going to have to shoulder this cost . Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . We ' re doomed ! There is some really good news though !
