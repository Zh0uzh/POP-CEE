The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain .

I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . Is that so ? Why not ? ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . What's on ? Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? Ah . The Royal , I think . What time does it start ? Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . But we won't have enough time for dinner . Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . Then , there's a 9:30 show . That's Okay , I think . All right .",

January 5th . Let ' s see . . . you ' re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life .

No , it ' s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .

No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown . Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . I wonder if you can cook things this good . I'm a great cook actually . You will see .",

Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine .",

Thanks for inviting me . My pleasure . I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that .

Thanks for inviting me . My pleasure . I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that .

We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? Exactly , now , tell me the time .",

So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . No way ! What do you mean ? We're going up to the \" new \" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ? No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown . Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . I wonder if you can cook things this good . I'm a great cook actually . You will see .",

Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ' s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ' s begin ! I need a volunteer . Me ! Me ! Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ' s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ' s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ' s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . Wait , what are you doing ? I ' m a married woman ! You can ' t just try to kiss me like this ! Madam I ' m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . Well , OK . But no French kissing ! As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ' s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . Wait , what are you doing !

Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? I don't think it's broken . well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! fine . I'll go vacuum .

And I need a printer . Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3 . It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? History . Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your Thirty percent ? Yes . Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? Yes . It's an excellent system . Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . What ? Are you serious ? Yes . But nobody uses Macintosh ! That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome .

So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . Please go ahead , I am listening . I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . Is your back door higher than the ground level ? Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . I don't like things to be fancy . Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? Cedar is a good choice . Well , let's take the measurements right now .",

I ' m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ' s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ' s . She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? There ' s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . I ' m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . I ' Ve seen them before . They ' re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ' s one place you have to go . Where ' s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ' s the waxworks museum . There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . Sometimes , it ' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum !",

So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too . Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum . Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . No way ! What do you mean ? We're going up to the \" new \" Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food . Will it be dim sum again ? No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown . Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . I wonder if you can cook things this good . I'm a great cook actually . You will see .",

She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . You need a babysitter . Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights . I could have Suzy stay at my place . I don't want to do that to you , Karen . Why not ? Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older . I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .",

No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast . We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the \" new \" Chinatown . Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? No , dim sum is more Cantonese style . But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . I wonder if you can cook things this good . I'm a great cook actually . You will see .",
