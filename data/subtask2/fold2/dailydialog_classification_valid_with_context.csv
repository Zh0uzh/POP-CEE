Did you sleep well last night ? I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . What's that ? Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . That's annoying , but nothing to worry about . For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . Ok , I'll try that . Is there anything else bothering you ? Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . Do you have any other plans this weekend ? I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . Try not to take on more than you can handle . You're right . I probably should just work on my paper .

Why did you buy a brick ? There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick . And ? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . And it's a brick ? Yes . I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?",0,dailydialog_va_86_utt_2_impossible_cause_utt_2

What happened ? Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! That's not very fair . What did you do ? There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure .

No , that ' s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . I see . This sounds interesting !

She ' s gonna kill me ! <SEP> Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? <SEP> Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you . You can ask me any question at any time .",0,dailydialog_va_710_utt_5_impossible_cause_utt_2

390,"happiness <SEP> Thank you . <SEP> Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . <SEP> Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ? I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . Really ? Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . Why did they want to found a college ? Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . Oh , I see . Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you . You can ask me any question at any time .",0,dailydialog_va_835_utt_6_impossible_cause_utt_4

Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . Any other common customs of your New Year ? Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . What's that ? It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government .

Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . Well , if you want we can go together sometime .

First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . How do you research your books ? I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .

682,"happiness <SEP> I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . <SEP> This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . <SEP> What's wrong ? I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's "" chi "" . But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap .",0,dailydialog_va_474_utt_4_impossible_cause_utt_4

Thanks for inviting me . My pleasure . I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . Not really .

Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line .

You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future .",0,dailydialog_va_76_utt_1_impossible_cause_utt_4

828,"happiness <SEP> Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . <SEP> Not funny . <SEP> Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? It ' s a skill . What can I say ? I don ' t know why , I just have a long routine . Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ' s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ' re out the door . Half an hour , tops . Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ' ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ' s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? Not funny .",0,dailydialog_va_848_utt_1_impossible_cause_utt_1

In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . I see . That ' s convenient !

Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA !

1037,"happiness <SEP> Well , I think you look nice today too . <SEP> What ? Why do we have to do that ? <SEP> Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? What ? Why do we have to do that ? Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon !

I don't think you ' re going to lose your job over one mistake . It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . But it wasn ' t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . That ' s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ' s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ' m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ' s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ' t believe me if I tell him the truth . Let ' s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ' d rather invest my money somehow . Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . Well , that ' s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . That ' s very generous of you . I guess that would work . If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ' ll save plenty of money .

No wonder you say English is a crazy language .",0,dailydialog_va_184_utt_9_impossible_cause_utt_2

He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick .

Without traffic , it takes about an hour . I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? Yes , I think so . It doesn ' t close until 5 o ' clock . You still have plenty of time . Great ! Thank you ! My pleasure , and have a good time !",0,dailydialog_va_472_utt_2_impossible_cause_utt_3

Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .",0,dailydialog_va_472_utt_2_impossible_cause_utt_4
